Noah is a Darwin subsystem for Linux, or more clearly, WSL for Mac OS X. It is implemented as a hypervisor that traps linux system calls and translates them to Darwin's system calls. Noah also has an interpreter of ELF files so that binary executables of Linux run directly and flawlessly without any modifications.
